What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
A hidden subdirectory .git is created. This subdirectory is maintained by git and indicates that the parent directory is under version control of git.


How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?
Staging Area sits in between the Working Directory and the Repository.
Use "git add <pathspec>" to place a file to Staging Area  
Use "git reset <pathspec>" to remove from staging area. git reset has other usages...
OR use "git rm --cached <pathspec>" to remove from staging area.
Use git commit to place all files in the staging area at once to the repository.
While editing commit messages, the convention is to use verbs as commands ie write
add this feature, NOT added this feature.
